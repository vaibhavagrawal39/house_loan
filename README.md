House-Loan-Data-Analysis

Description-:
For safe and secure lending experience, it's important to analyse the past data. In this project, you have to build a deep learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans using the historical data. As you will see, this dataset is highly imbalanced and includes a lot of features that make this problem more challenging.

Objective: Create a model that predicts whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan using historical data.
